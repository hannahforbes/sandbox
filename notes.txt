React is a javascript library that is used to create UIs
We create useable components and these components display data as it changes over time
Since 2013 (when React was created), it has been expanded to Reactive Native which is for mobile

//Inspecting React Sites
Added a couple of extensions to the browser...
React detector: react symbol on search bar, shows blue when page is using react
React developer: allows you to see which components are being used on a react webpage
N.B.: Use cmd + alt + j to open developer tools on mac

//Efficient rendering with React
The DOM is the structure of HTML elements that make up a webpage
The DOM API refers to how these page elements are accessed and changed
React made updating the DOM faster by using DOM Diffing
DOM Diffing happens when you compare the currently rendered content with the new UI changes that are about to be made
React optimizes this by making only the minimal changes necessary
React compares JavaScript objects instead of always writing to or reading from the DOM
In normal circumstance:
    JavaScript Logic is interacting with the DOM to make updates
    Using functions such as getElementById you are READING from the DOM
    When you change any of those .e.g change classes, change content... you are WRITING to the DOM
Reading & Writing to DOM is slow, dealing with JS Objects is faster
Using React is like adding a layer in between JS Logic and DOM called the "React DOM"
All changed from JS Logic are read/written to React DOM and then React DOM reads/writes only necessary changes to the actual DOM
We never read from the actual DOM (only the React DOM) and we only write to it when changes are required

//Building with Webpack
In previous videos we looked at how the Babel CLI can help us transpile JavaScript that uses new syntax into static files that uses browser-supported syntax
This approach offers performance benefits in the browser because all transpiling happens before run time
As an alternative to this we can use module bundlers like Webpack to handle some of this work for us
Webpack is a module bundler that helps us create static files and helps us automate processes that need to happen before our files can go into production
Think about one typical html file, we might load several different scripts, making several HTTP requests
Webpack will run several commands at a time to create a bundle file
This bundle packages scripts, dependancies and even CSS into one file
...and one file means one request

The first thing we need to do to use webpack is we're going to create a webpack config file
